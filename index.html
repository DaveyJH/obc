          <p>
            Sometimes life throws you a curveball, and you find your email
            provider blocking an email with a simple set of PDFs for a job
            application. Rather than accept defeat, I took this as an
            opportunity to showcase my skills in a more creative way. I hope
            this basic HTML page serves as a testament to my enthusiasm,
            existing competency and my approach to problem solving.

              Not much really! It's a simple page for a simple purpose; to
              provide my cover letter and CV in a format that is not blocked by
              email providers. The requirements of the site don't need
              JavaScript but feel free to nose around my GitHub for some older
              projects.

              The name of your company seems coincidently on the right track for
              me, bear with me as I explain...

              I am excited by this opportunity to present myself to you. I like
              to think outside the box and I am a keen critical thinker. Right
              now, I help develop and maintain a variety of services for a
              software education company. My daily tasks include working with
              front and back-end services, utilising Python, JavaScript, APIs,
              databases, Docker containerisation and AWS. I moved into the
              engineering team within the last year and I am now facing
              redundancy. Maybe it's the universe's way of telling me that it's
              time to climb aboard and move on.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before transitioning into software development, I worked for
              several years in the security systems industry - installing,
              maintaining and integrating CCTV, IP video systems and access
              control. It gave me a great insight into how physical systems and
              infrastructure connect with technology. That background is one of
              the reasons I'm excited about what you do. That train of thought
              stretches back even further - I completed work experience up on
              St. Philip's Marsh in one of the train depots. I appreciate not
              everybody is superstitious but I like to think that the signals
              are trying to tell me something here.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have developed a variety of skills in my eclectic career history
              that allow me to learn quickly and efficiently, with a keen
              ambition to continue developing. I am working through a part-time
              course studying Data Analytics with AI, building skills in data
              visualisation, machine learning and ETL processes. With that in
              mind, I am actually interested in both junior roles you have
              advertised; Junior Software Developer and Junior
              Systems/Production Engineer.
            </p>
            <p>
              My initial career in the mechanical trade was a great cornerstone
              to learning and approaching problems with a 'bigger picture'
              mentality. I went from a complete novice to running a workshop
              within 5 years. As cars became more reliant on electrical control
              units, I pushed myself to learn electrical diagnostics as my first
              employer was reluctant to do so himself. A rule I taught myself
              during this time -
              <em
                >If you cannot understand and replicate the issue, you cannot be
                certain you are fixing it.</em
              >
              This is a motto I have continued to use throughout my career and
              everyday life. I am a firm believer that a better comprehension of
              systems enables me to push boundaries and provide an excellent
              solution to any situation.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm fortunate to be in a position where I can take a salary
              reduction and I am interested in a role that will allow me to grow
              and develop my skills further, alongside a like-minded team. I
              believe that One Big Circle might be the company to help me
              achieve that and, very fittingly, continue on my own big circle of
              a journey.

          I hope this application has created a positive impression. If so, I
          would love to discuss the possibility of joining the One Big Circle
          team and becoming an active contributer to a product making an impact
          in the real world.
